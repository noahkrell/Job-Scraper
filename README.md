Built a simple job-post-aggregator to help me consolidate job-listings as I look for junior-dev roles (credit: BuiltIn.com for job posts).
- Ruby on Rails + Nokogiri + HTML/CSS + Deployed on Heroku... You can view it live on the interwebs in its current state [here](https://job-scraper-2018.herokuapp.com/).
